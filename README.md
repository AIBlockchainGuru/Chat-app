Clone this repo, install the dependencies (all locally), and run the development server (which auto-watches the
files for changes):

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

The development app will be running on `http://localhost:3000`. Development builds have the advantage of not requiring
a build step, but can be slower than production builds. Also, development builds won't have timeout on edge functions.

## üåê Deploy manually

The _production_ build of the application is optimized for performance and is performed by the `npm run build` command,
after installing the required dependencies.

```bash
# .. repeat the steps above up to `npm install`, then:
npm run build
npm run start --port 3000
```

The app will be running on the specified port, e.g. `http://localhost:3000`.
